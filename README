Original model by Paul Toxopeus "Large Summer Tree".

LDraw model by Johannes Schauer, released under CC-BY.

The model was made after the images and videos released by Paul Toxopeus:

For a bricklink XML convert the following part IDs:

convert 4460 -> 4460b
convert 3040b -> 3040
convert 4032a -> 4032

The following additions were made to the *.pov file generated by LDView:

	#version 3.6;
	
	#include "rad_def.inc"
	
	global_settings {
	                max_trace_level 10
	                radiosity {
	                                Rad_Settings(Radiosity_Final, on, off)
	                }
	}
	
	light_source {  // X, Y, Z
	                <-1000, -1500, -1000>
	                color rgb 1.0
	                area_light 200, 200, 10, 10
	                jitter
	}
	
	#declare LDXSkipLight1 = 1;
	#declare LDXSkipLight2 = 1;
	#declare LDXSkipLight3 = 1;

and in the end:

	// Fog
	fog {
	        distance LDXRadius*25
	        color rgb 1
	}

The rendering was done as 2480x3506 (portrait A4 at 118 dots per cm).

Convert the image into the cover pdf using:

	convert tree.bmp -compress jpeg -quality 95 -units PixelsPerCentimeter -density 118x118 cover.pdf

Convert the image into a foggy grayscale background image using:

	convert -modulate 100,0,100 tree.bmp -size 2480x3506 xc:white -compose dissolve -define compose:args=85,100 -composite tree-foggy.png

The pdf generated by LPub was postprocessed using:

	pdfcrop --bbox "0 166 596 1008" tree.pdf tree-cropped.pdf

To make it A4 sized. Then run pdfsizeopt over the result to compress the PDF
further.

	./pdfsizeopt tree-cropped.pdf tree-pso.pdf

That was then processed by pdfopt. Because pdftk can't handle the pdfsizeopt
output.

	pdfopt tree-pso.pdf tree-opt.pdf

And then connected with the cover page:

	pdftk cover.pdf tree-opt.pdf output tree-final.pdf
